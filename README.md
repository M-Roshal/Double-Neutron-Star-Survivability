The main program is titled Kick_survival_final. It contains a simulation of survival of binary neutron star systems

Another important program is WD_mass_loss. It illustrates that despite current assumptions, helium white dwarfs are likely to have assymtric mass loss during late stages of their existense.

DNS_mass_func is a function to simulate neutron star's and its companion's mass before and after the explosion of this neutron star.
Eccentricity_reversal uses current DNS data to reverse circularization effects via negative-time IVP integration.
DNS_survival_circular_ellptical solves two-body problem for an exploding NS and its comapnion, in elliptical and circular cases.

Important!
The data used in simulations is from ATNF pulsar catalogue and is available online at:
